Gem-Based Admins for Clearance

Do you like movies about gladiators or Clearance-based authentication? If you do, you and Captain Oveur will become fast friends. Captain Oveur adds user-management tools and admin authentication to make flights of web development smoother.

Tested with Rails 2.3.5 and Clearance 0.8.8

Install it as a gem: gem install captain_oveur

script/generate captain_oveur

for the cucumber features:

script/generate captain_oveur_features

NOTE

A lot of this gem looks exactly like clearance. Firstly, I am an unabashed fan of thoughtbot and clearance. Given the problem domain, I also think it was the best way to handle a lot of issues, but I am open to criticism and suggestions.
