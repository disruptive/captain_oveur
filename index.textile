h3(airstream). Gem-Based Admins for Clearance

Do you like movies about gladiators or "Clearance-based":http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance authentication? If you do, you and Captain Oveur will become fast friends. Captain Oveur adds user-management tools and admin authentication to make flights of web development smoother.

Tested with Rails 2.3.5 and Clearance 0.8.8

Install it as a gem (after installing the clearance gem, then "script/generate"-ing clearance, cucumber and clearance_features): 

@gem install captain_oveur@

@script/generate captain_oveur@

To use the cucumber features for Captain_Oveur:

@script/generate captain_oveur_features@

NOTE #1

A lot of this gem looks exactly like "clearance":http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance. Firstly, I am an unabashed fan of "thoughtbot":http://thoughtbot.com and clearance. Given the problem domain, I also think it was the best way to handle a lot of issues, but I am open to criticism and/or suggestions.

NOTE #2

It looks like nearly 50 people downloaded 0.8.9, and for that I am truly sorry. 

0.8.9 was kind of a mess - a few of the filenames were maimed by an unruly git client, making it unusable. 

0.8.10 fixes all of that and makes a few other improvements.
