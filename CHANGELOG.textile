0.8.12 (7/14/2010)

* removed "admin" level of folders under controllers - not needed when namespacing in the routes
* removed "captain_oveur" level of folders under views - made overriding kind of hairy...
* added append_view_path to users_controller to catch views in views/admin/users

0.8.11 (7/5/2010)

* moved controllers and views 1 level deeper in engine to facilitate overriding them (overriding example coming soon to wiki)

0.8.10 (7/5/2010)
